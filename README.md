## Inspiration
Looking up symptoms on web browsers often gives scary and inaccurate results. I wanted to create a platform where users can have a better and accurate preliminary diagnosis.
## What does it do?
An online symptom checker that provides a preliminary diagnosis based on the symptoms provided by the users.
## How did I built it?
Technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, API (https://apimedic.com/) to receive the required medical information have been used
